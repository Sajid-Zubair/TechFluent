## üìù Prompt Design

- ## Technical Question Prompt Design
    Generate one short and concise theoretical random technical interview question for the subject: {subject}.  
    The question should be answerable solely by speaking (oral answer), not by writing code or lengthy explanations.  
    Include only questions that are commonly asked or might be asked in real interviews.

- ## Behavioural Question Prompt Design
    Generate one concise behavioral interview question that is commonly asked or likely to be asked in interviews.  
    The question should encourage the candidate to share real experiences or examples, be answerable orally with a focused narrative,  
    and explore qualities like teamwork, problem-solving, communication, adaptability, or leadership.
